## Installation <a name="installation"></a>

Plotly library must be installed. It is an interactive, open-source, and browser-based graphing library for Python (includes Plotly Express).  

`pip install plotly==5.4.0`

Inside [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/install) (installable with `pip install "jupyterlab>=3" "ipywidgets>=7.6"`).

The code should run with no issues using Python versions 3.*.

## Project Motivation<a name="motivation"></a>

In the telecom industry, customers are able to choose from multiple service providers and actively switch from one operator to another. In this highly competitive market, the telecommunications industry experiences an average of 15-25% annual churn rate. Given the fact that it costs 5-10 times more to acquire a new customer than to retain an existing one, customer retention has now become even more important than customer acquisition. So we need to analyse telecom industry data and predict high value customers who are at high risk of churn and identify main indicators of churn. In this project, I will analyze customer-level data of a leading telecom firm and identify the main indicators of churn.

## File Descriptions <a name="files"></a>

There is a notebook available here to showcase work related to the required analysis.  The notebook is exploratory in searching through the data pertaining to the questions showcased through notebook.  Markdown cells were used to assist in walking through the thought process for individual steps.  


## Results<a name="results"></a>

The main findings of the code can be found at the post available [here](https://medium.com/@josh_2774/how-do-you-become-a-developer-5ef1c1c68711).

## Licensing, Authors, Acknowledgements<a name="licensing"></a>

Must give credit to IBM for the data.  You can find the Licensing for the data and other descriptive information at the Kaggle link available [here](https://www.kaggle.com/blastchar/telco-customer-churn).  Otherwise, feel free to use the code here as you would like!
